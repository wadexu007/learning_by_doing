## What's in this repo?
This repository contains a list of my practices when learning by doing for DevOps, SRE & Cloud Infrastructure.

## üìí Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to centralize all practices of my learning by doing in order to present a way to understand and develop Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps skills.

The content of this repository is based on a return of several years of experience in the industry and a willingness to share content that may still be unknown to some people who would like to evolve in their career or open themselves to new opportunities.
